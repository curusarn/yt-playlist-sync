# yt-playlist-sync
Youtube playlist one-way synchronizer/downloader

## Why u do dis?
rg3/youtube-dl can download whole youtube playlists, why do we need this repo?

When you download playlist with youtube-dl it downloads whole playlist again.

The point of yt-playlist-SYNC is to download just the new songs.

## Dependencies

### rg3/youtube-dl
You need to download this. You can probably get this from your distro's official repos.

### robgibbons/youParse
No need to download this â€“ I included it in my repo.
