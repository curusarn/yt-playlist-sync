**PROJECT IS IN EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT AND UNDERGOES MANY CHANGES**

# yt-playlist-sync
Youtube playlist one-way synchronizer/downloader

## Why u do dis?
rg3/youtube-dl can download whole youtube playlists, why do we need this repo?

When you have older version of playlist downloaded and you want to download just the new songs and not the ones you already have, that's when yt-playlist-sync comes to use. 

## Dependencies

### rg3/youtube-dl
You need to download this. You can probably get this from your distro's official repos.

### robgibbons/youParse
No need to download this â€“ I included it in my repo.
